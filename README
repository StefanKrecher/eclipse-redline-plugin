Redline Smalltalk is a Smalltalk for the Java Virtual Machine, because nothing is as
productive as Smalltalk, and the App has to run on the Java Virtual Machine.

The eclipse-redline-plugin aims to support
- Java-Developers who need to work in an eclipse-environment but who want to step into new horizons by using the power of Smalltalk
- Smalltalk-Developers who are familiar with Smalltalk-Environments but who need to dive into the Java-World
- Developers who want use the best of both worlds and who want to bring the fun back to programming!
